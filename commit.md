## git commit

**git commit *[file]***- Record the changes made to the files to a local repository. For easy reference, each commit has a unique ID.

Itâ€™s best practice to include a message with each commit explaining the changes made in a commit. Adding a commit message helps to find a particular change or understanding the changes.


```bash=
# Adding a commit with message
$ git commit -m "Commit message in quotes"
```

```bash=
$ git commit -m "My first commit message"
[SecretTesting 0254c3d] My first commit message
