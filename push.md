## git push

**git push *[file]***- Sends local commits to the remote repository. git push requires two parameters: the remote repository and the branch that the push is for.

Usage:

```bash=
$ git push <remote_URL/remote_name> <branch>

# Push all local branches to remote repository
$ git push â€”all
```
in Practice:

```bash=
# Push a specific branch to a remote with named remote
$ git push origin staging
