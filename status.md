## git status

**git status *[file]***- This command returns the current state of the repository.

git status will return the current working branch. If a file is in the staging area, but not committed, it shows with git status. Or, if there are no changes itâ€™ll return nothing to commit, working directory clean.

Usage:

```bash=
$ git status
```
in Practice:

```bash=
# Message when files have not been staged (git add)
$ git status
On branch SecretTesting
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

  	homepage/index.html

# Message when files have been not been committed (git commit)
$ git status
On branch SecretTesting
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/SecretTesting'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   homepage/index.html

# Message when all files have been staged and committed 
$ git status
On branch SecretTesting
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```
